# Processes and Signals

This project introduces Linux processes and signals. It covers:
- Managing process lifecycles
- Monitoring running processes
- Using signals to control process behavior

Through hands-on tasks, learners will practice identifying process IDs, manipulating processes, and handling signals to start, stop, and modify processes.
